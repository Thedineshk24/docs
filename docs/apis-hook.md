# APIs hook

In React Play, we work with APIs by using our custom-made react hooks. They are as follows:

1. [useCacheResponse](#usecacheresponse)
1. [useContributors](#usecontributors)
1. [useFeaturedPlays](#usefeaturedplays)
1. [useFetch](#usefetch)
1. [useGetPlays](#usegetplays)
1. [useGitHub](#usegithub)
1. [useLikePlays](#uselikeplays)
1. [useLocalStorage](#uselocalstorage)

In this section, we will discuss each of them in detail.
