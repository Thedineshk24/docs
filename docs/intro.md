# ReactPlay?

![banner](./img/banner.png)

**ReactPlay** is an OpenSource platform to **create, learn and share** ReactJS projects with the developer community. Here we emphasize learning by creation. Hence create before *learn*ing.

**Create** → You as a learner have the complete freedom to create any project. Have an idea and want to convert that to reality, go ahead. Want to recreate something you saw on the internet, you are welcome to do so. Or you can simply browse the [plays](https://reactplay.io/plays) submitted by our fabulous developer community and take inspiration.

**Learn** → To create a project you need to learn a host of technologies. That’s obvious. But, does the learning stop there in **ReactPlay**? Not really. Here, once you submit your project, the code goes through a serious [code review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review) by experienced developers. In the review process, there is a constant back and forth with the experienced devs where you learn [industry best practices](https://github.com/reactplay/react-play/wiki/ReactPlay-Code-Review-Checklist), performance, etc… _In short, you learn to “Think in React”_.

**Share** → Once the code review is successful, your play is accepted and you are now a part of the **ReactPlay** community. Yay!! 🥳 This also counts as an open-source contribution and your work will now be available on the ReactPlay platform for others to explore. You continue to learn if and when someone starts learning from your project and asks you questions about how you achieved certain things. Or requests a new feature and in many other ways.
