# Contribute to Docs

[ReactPlay Docs](docs.reactplay.io/) is our official documentation for ReactPlay. As the name suggests, it includes documentation of various aspects and features of ReactPlay.

If you've come so far, _you_ already consider yourself a part of _ReactPlay_. And guess what, we have accepted you too. We are family!! üéâ. Henceforth we grow together.

- write documentation for various parts of ReactPlay
- suggest changes to the existing docs
- improve the documentation

## Setting up

To start contributing you must first set up this repository on your local machine. Follow the steps below to set up the repository on your local machine.

### üç¥ Fork and Clone the Repo

1. Go to [reactplay/docs](https://github.com/reactplay/docs) and <span className="fork"><svg className="svg" aria-hidden="true" height="14" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" data-view-component="true">

2. Click the <span className="code"><svg className="svg" aria-hidden="true" height="14" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" data-view-component="true">

   </svg>Code</span> and copy the URL

```bash
   git clone <URL_LINK>
```

3. Change directory into the folder where you have cloned the repo.

```bash
cd <directory-name>
```

### ‚¨Ü Set Upstream

We recommend setting an upstream repo to make pulling and fetching easier. Execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/reactplay/docs
```

Check if the upstream has been added by executing the following command:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see the following displayed in your terminal.

```bash
origin  https://github.com/<username>/reactplay-docs.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/<username>/reactplay-docs.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/reactplay/docs.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/reactplay/docs.git (push)
```

### üå¥ Create a branch

Ideally, you must create a separate branch for each issue you are working on. Here is how to create a new branch locally.

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

> The `-b` command switches the current branch to the newly created branch.

Keep the branch name clear and straightforward.

üéä Congratulations! You are ready to start working on the issue!

### üë®‚Äçüíª Make changes

You need to install dependencies before you start working on the website. Make sure you are in the same directory as your repo's `package.json` and execute either of the following commands:

```bash
yarn install
```

> We recommend using Yarn. But feel free to use NPM as well:

```bash
npm install
```

To start a local development server, enter the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

Or, for NPM:

```bash
npm run start
```

The local development server will start on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

### üîí Commit and Push

You can save your changes by committing them. Committing once you have made significant changes to the repo is recommended. Execute the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "<message>"
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

The `message` should be a descriptive text defining your changes since the last commit.
The `branch-name` is the branch name you created before working on this issue.

You can create multiple commits before pushing the code.

### üôå Pull Request

When you have resolved the issue, its time to make a pull request.
Open the forked repo from GitHub web and go to `Pull Requests` tab. Then click the bright green `New Pull Request` button.

Select the _base_ and _compare_ branches carefully. Base is the branch you are merging your changes with whereas Compare is the branch you made your changes to.

Click `Create Pull Request` and wait until we review and merge it.

Until it gets merged, browse [ReactPlay](https://reactplay.io/) and [contribute](https://github.com/reactplay/react-play) to it.
