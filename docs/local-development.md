```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Create a `.env` file at the root of your project folder with the following content,

```bash
REACT_APP_NHOST_BACKEND_URL=https://rgkjmwftqtbpayoyolwh.nhost.run/
REACT_APP_NHOST_VERSION=v1
REACT_APP_NHOST_ENDPOINT=graphql
```

## Start the Development Mode

Use the following command to start the app in the development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

Or

```bash
yarn start
```

It runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.
